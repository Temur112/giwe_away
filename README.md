# give_away

A new Flutter project for mobile programming semester 5.

GiveAway application where anyone can get an item or give it to others for free through 
the application. The app starts with a simple starting screen where the user may go to
the login, registration pages or just explore the app without logging in. 

We are working on the project in 2 laptops only as my laptop is not supporting some features of the project.
Here I just wanted to inform you about the reason why we are pushing in 2 accounts only. However, we are all
working on it.
