# give_away

A new Flutter project for mobile programming semester 5.

IMPORTANT: We have implemented following functionalities in our application:
* Logging in with e-mail and password(validation tests are all working properly. Checking both e-mail and password
you can see from the code also)
* Registering is also available with all validation tests.
* Adding a new product as a user
* Showing available products from the database
* User details are shown in Profile Page
* Navigating and Routing are working properly

(In the video we submitted through the link, we could not show all of the functions as in the last time we run the 
application API took to long to connect. However, you can see those functions in the code)

GiveAway application where anyone can get an item or give it to others for free through 
the application. The app starts with a simple starting screen where the user may go to
the login, registration pages or just explore the app without logging in. 

We are working on the project in 2 laptops only as my laptop is not supporting some features of the project.
Here I just wanted to inform you about the reason why we are pushing in 2 accounts only. However, we are all
working on it.
